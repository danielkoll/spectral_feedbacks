# Spectral feedback scripts

Scripts for computing the clearsky longwave spectral feedback expressions from Koll et al 2023. These scripts provide analytic approximations for the spectral terms that make up Earth's longwave clearsky feedback, and might or might not work well outside the parameter regime in which they were tested. Even for present-day Earth, they are only an approximation.

# How to use for simple calculations (requires python, numpy, matplotlib)

1. compute theoretical brightness temperatures:

cd $spectral_feedbacks

python -i plot_theory_brightness_temps.py


2. compute spectral feedbacks as a function of surface temperature:

cd $spectral_feedbacks

python -i plot_theory_spectral_feedbacks.py


# How to use for advanced calculations (requires jupyter, xarray)

3. compute spatial feedback maps (need additional ERA5 data):

cd $spectral_feedbacks

jupyter notebook

-> open plot_theory_feedback_map.ipynb

-> run script

resulting output:
